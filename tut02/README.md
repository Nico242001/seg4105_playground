## Chapter 2

This chapter introduced the basic principles of shaping. It highlights how important it is not to define too many details, as this will cause developers to focus on the wrong things during development. It is also important not to give too little information as this would not be enough to properly guide developers. They can't read minds, so they can't guess what someone wants.

There are 3 main properties to shaped work. Property 1, It's Rough, it means the work is unfinished, allowing designers and programmers to apply their own judgment. Property 2, It's solved, this means that even if the work is not finished, it has been thought through and all the elements necessary for the solution are present. Property 3, It's Bounded, what not to do, when and where to stop are all defined.

The book gave an example of how to use shaping for the development of a calendar. It uses this example to show that shaping should be used to indicate what should be done and what should not be done during a fixed a preiod of time. The four main steps of shaping are set boundaries, rough out the elements, address risks and rabbit holes and write the pitch.

## Chapter 3

This chapter focuses on setting boundaries (Defining what you are trying to do). This explains how important it is not to rush into work when it first presents itself. An assessment of the value of the idea should take place to determine whether time can be invested in it. Appetite is what allows you to determine the time budget (small batch or large batch). An appetite is not an estimate, you first set how long and try to fit in work within that time frame. The best solution always depends on time.

It's important not to get too excited about a new idea, as it can create unrealistic expectations. You should always delve into the request/idea before starting them. A very complex request/idea that could take a very long time might have an alternative solution that could take very little time in comparison. In doing so, you also narrow down the problem and try to understand what is driving the demand. It is also necessary to monitor requests asking for a "redesign", a "refactor"... not motivated by a simple problem.

## Chapter 4

This chapter focuses on finding the elements. First we need to find the right people for the job, either need to be alone or with someone of similar knoweledge and ability. It's critical to avoid the wrong detail in wireframes, no unecessary details in order to not restrict. A concept from electrical engineering called breadboarding is used in order to set the correct level of abstraction. The drawing for this step will contain 3 components, places which is a place in the product like a home page, affordances actions the user can do and connection lines how affordance navigate's a user.

At the end of the mockups should be able to have a small to do list. This should start to give direction to the task while leaving room for creativity with the designers.

## Chapter 5

This chapter focuses on finding any potential issues that could impact the project. The concept of rabbit holes is introduced which is an unexpected challenge that can disturb the project. If a rabbit hole does present itself it can cause the project to be abandoned or restarted at a later date. That is why it is critical to exam all aspects of the potential solution. In order to prevent potentiel problems we can use "patching", it's like making a clear and simple design to simplify a major problem. 

If a certain feature ends up being to complicated it might be worth to evaluate once again if it's worth implimenting, might need to cut back on certain aspects. It's also important to talk with technical experts as it's important to determine if a feature is possible within the time given for the project. It also allows you to go over any possible risk that could come up during your project.
