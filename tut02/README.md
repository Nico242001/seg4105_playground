## Chapter 2

This chapter introduced the basic principales of shaping. It states how important it is to not set too much detail as it would make developpers concentrate on the wrong things during development. It is also important to not give too little imformation as this would not be enough information to properly guide developers. They arent mind readers, so they cant guess what someone wants.

It gave an example of how to use shaping for the development of a calendar. It uses this example to show that shaping should be used to indicate what should be done and what should not be done during a fixed a preiod of time. The four main steps of shaping are set boundaries, rough out the elements, address risks and rabbit holes and write the pitch.

## Chapter 3

This chapter focuses on setting bounderies. It explains how it's important to not jump the gun on work when it first present's itself. It's important not to get too excited over the a task as it can set unrealistic expectations. You need to be able to set appetite, this allow's to set how much work is able to be done during a period of time. An appetite is not an estimate, you set how much time first and try to fit in work within that time.

Always need to dive into request before starting them. A very complex request that could take very long could have an alternative solution that could take very little time in comparaison. By doing so you are also to narrow down the problem.

## Chapter 4

This chapter focuses on finding the elements. First need to find the right people for the job, than need to set the correct level of detail in the designs. This drawing should allow for decision of a specific solution. For this you can use the process of breadboarding, this give's the right level of abstraction. The drawing for this step will contain 3 components, places, affordances and connection lines.

It used an example of auto pay, the place is where the customer can activate auto pay. Affordance is more like how you+ turn it on and the connection lines is more the steps to get to it.
