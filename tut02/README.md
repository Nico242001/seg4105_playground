## Chapter 2

This chapter introduced the basic principles of shaping. It highlights how important it is not to define too many details, as this will cause developers to focus on the wrong things during development. It is also important not to give too little information as this would not be enough to properly guide developers. They can't read minds, so they can't guess what someone wants.

There are 3 main properties to shaped work. Property 1, It's Rough, it means the work is unfinished, allowing designers and programmers to apply their own judgment. Property 2, It's solved, this means that even if the work is not finished, it has been thought through and all the elements necessary for the solution are present. Property 3, It's Bounded, what not to do, when and where to stop are all defined.

The book gave an example of how to use shaping for the development of a calendar. It uses this example to show that shaping should be used to indicate what should be done and what should not be done during a fixed a preiod of time. The four main steps of shaping are set boundaries, rough out the elements, address risks and rabbit holes and write the pitch.

## Chapter 3

This chapter focuses on setting bounderies. It explains how it's important to not jump the gun on work when it first present's itself. It's important not to get too excited over the a task as it can set unrealistic expectations. You need to be able to set appetite, this allow's to set how much work is able to be done during a period of time. An appetite is not an estimate, you set how much time first and try to fit in work within that time.

Always need to dive into request before starting them. A very complex request that could take very long could have an alternative solution that could take very little time in comparaison. By doing so you are also to narrow down the problem.

## Chapter 4

This chapter focuses on finding the elements. First need to find the right people for the job, than need to set the correct level of detail in the designs. This drawing should allow for decision of a specific solution. For this you can use the process of breadboarding, this give's the right level of abstraction. The drawing for this step will contain 3 components, places, affordances and connection lines.

It used an example of auto pay, the place is where the customer can activate auto pay. Affordance is more like how you+ turn it on and the connection lines is more the steps to get to it.
