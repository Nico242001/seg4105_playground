## Chapter 2

This chapter introduced the basic principles of shaping. It highlights how important it is not to define too many details, as this will cause developers to focus on the wrong things during development. It is also important not to give too little information as this would not be enough to properly guide developers. They can't read minds, so they can't guess what someone wants.

There are 3 main properties to shaped work. Property 1, It's Rough, it means the work is unfinished, allowing designers and programmers to apply their own judgment. Property 2, It's solved, this means that even if the work is not finished, it has been thought through and all the elements necessary for the solution are present. Property 3, It's Bounded, what not to do, when and where to stop are all defined.

The book gave an example of how to use shaping for the development of a calendar. It uses this example to show that shaping should be used to indicate what should be done and what should not be done during a fixed a preiod of time. The four main steps of shaping are set boundaries, rough out the elements, address risks and rabbit holes and write the pitch.

## Chapter 3

This chapter focuses on setting boundaries (Defining what you are trying to do). This explains how important it is not to rush into work when it first presents itself. An assessment of the value of the idea should take place to determine whether time can be invested in it. Appetite is what allows you to determine the time budget (small batch or large batch). An appetite is not an estimate, you first set how long and try to fit in work within that time frame. The best solution always depends on time.

It's important not to get too excited about a new idea, as it can create unrealistic expectations. You should always delve into the request/idea before starting them. A very complex request/idea that could take a very long time might have an alternative solution that could take very little time in comparison. In doing so, you also narrow down the problem and try to understand what is driving the demand. It is also necessary to monitor requests asking for a "redesign", a "refactor"... not motivated by a simple problem.

## Chapter 4

This chapter focuses on finding the elements. First we need to find the right people for the job, either need to be alone or with someone of similar knoweledge and ability. It's critical to avoid the wrong detail in wireframes, no unecessary details in order to not restrict. A concept from electrical engineering called breadboarding is used in order to set the correct level of abstraction.



than need to set the correct level of detail in the designs. This drawing should allow for decision of a specific solution. For this you can use the process of breadboarding, this give's the right level of abstraction. The drawing for this step will contain 3 components, places, affordances and connection lines.

It used an example of auto pay, the place is where the customer can activate auto pay. Affordance is more like how you+ turn it on and the connection lines is more the steps to get to it.
