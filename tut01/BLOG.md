## The importance of a good project manager

A good project manager is crucial to the success of any project. The roles and skills could vary from manager to manager but they will all have a few in common. All project managers are important decision makers, what they say goes. The types of situations in which they make decisions can greatly vary. 

Some of these situations could be about the design and architecture of a project. In this case it is important for him to be very knowledgeable of the field of the project and the requirements of the project. A mistake for a decision related to this could cause the project to have an increased development time, higher development cost, lower quality and lower performance. These are all unwanted outcomes that could cause the client or product owner to be very unhappy with the performance of the team and project. The project manager can also have to deal with conflicts within his own team. In these cases he will have to make decisions in order to resolve these conflicts. 

It is important for the manager to properly resolve conflicts between team members in order to have a good and healthy working environment. If conflicts go unresolved it could contribute to a toxic work atmosphere. A toxic work environment would greatly disrupt the team's productivity, cause delays and negatively impact the quality of work. 

A manager will also have to assign tasks, for this to be done effectively it is important for him to know his team. Each individual has strengths and weaknesses. A manager should be able to assign tasks to team members that align with those strengths in order to produce good quality work within the time frame desired. If a manager fails to do so the team would have to sacrifice time or quality in order to complete the task.

In conclusion it is now obvious how the project manager is critical to the success of a project, these are also only one of many other roles and decisions a manager will have to make over the course of a project's lifetime.
