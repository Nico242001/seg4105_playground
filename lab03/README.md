# The task 
Build a mortgage calculator, for monthly mortgage payments depending on rates and down payments.

# Set Boundaries

## Raw idea
Customers have been asking for a way to know if they can afford a particular house.

## Appetite
This is a big batch, the project can be done in approximately 6 weeks with 2 members sharing the responsibilities of designer and programmer.

## Narrow Problem Definition
The mortgage calculator would allow people to evaluate the affordability of a home by calculating the monthly payments that would be needed in order to purchase it. This would allow people with little knowledge of a the home buying process to have a better understanding.

# Risk and Rabbit Holes
Here are some of the rabbit holes I have been able to come up with.  
1- Including an option in the calculator for extra mortgage payments. 
2- Refinancing options within the calculator would potentially add much complexity. 
3- Allowing for the option of calculation with adjustable-rate mortgages. 
4- Allowing for implementation of every local regulation possible.
