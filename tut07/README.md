## Scrum

Scrum was developped by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland. It is a framework that can be used to address complex adaptive problems while delivering products productively. It is very simple to understand but hard to master. The scrum method allow's for continuous improvement of your product. Scrum consist of scrum teams, roles, events and other aspects.

Scrum was initially used toi develop and manage products, it as been used extensively worldwide for many other things like Research and identify viable markets, technologies, product capabilities and many more. The concept of scrum is a small team of people with high flexibility and adaptivity. Collaboration between individuals and teams is also an aspect of scrum.

People must transparent, inspect artifacts, adaptable. 4 formal events of scrum are sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint retrospective. There's 5 main values for scrum commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect.

Here are some of the roles found in a scrum team:

The product owner, it is one person and not a commity. Main objective is to maximize the value of the product. Responsible for managing: Clearly expressing Product Backlog items, Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to achieve goals and mission and many more.

The scrum master, leader of the scrum team. He ensures that the product owners goals objectives are followed. He leads the developpement team in this regarding the task needed to achieve the teams goals. 

Here are some events:

The Sprint, is a set time for developpement were certain task/features are set to achieve withing the time given. Only the product owner as the authority to cancel a Sprint before the time given is passed.

Sprint plainning, the scrum team works together to plan the next Sprint. The team will look at and determine what can be done from the backlog over the course of the next sprint in regards to the objective od the Product Owner.

Daily Scrum, the daily scrum is a 15 minute meeting done every day for the team to plan work for the next 24 hours. It can be used to discuss the work done in the past 24 hours as well. It is the Scrum master's job to ensure these meetings take place.

Sprint Review, it is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed. The team collaborates about what as been done over the Sprint.

Sprint Retrospective, the team meets after the Sprint review to discuss improvements that can be made, this meeting is supposed to be positive.

Artifacts:

Product Backlog, everything that is needed in a product, icludes all tasks, features, bugs and any other thing needed to implement for the product. It is important to review the backlog in order to not keep usless debt.

Sprint Backlog, is a set of Product Backlog items selected for a sprint to be completed.

## Show Progress

### Tasks that arent there

Initial to do list do not contain all the tasks that will be done for a project. As the work gets started more work/tasks get discovered this would then mean that the to do list needs to be modified by adding or removing new tasks as the projetct moves along. This can lead to missleading estimates therefore more context on the work inside the those scopes are needed to determine all upcoming work.

### Estimates dont show uncertainty

Theres estimates for two different types of tasks. One for a task a team as done several times, if a team in this case estimates 4 hours it can be confident it will take 4 hours to complete. The second of those task is a unfamiliar task, in this case if a team estimates 4 hours it might take 4 hours or it might take 3 days.

### Work is like a hill
