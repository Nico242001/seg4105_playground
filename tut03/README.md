# Summary Notes

## Pitch principals

What is a pitch?:  
-A formal pitch is a document of approximately 800 words.  
-It should contain the problem to be solved.  
-Proposes an idea or potential solution to solve the problem and gives direction to the project.  
-Should contain a certain level of abstraction.  
-Having too many details and specifications could lead the developers to spend too much time on the wrong details or lead the project in the wrong direction.  
-Too much abstraction is also not desired; for example, one ticket is not sufficient because the developer can't read minds.  

Who can pitch?:  
-Anyone with an idea can informaly pitch an idea.  
-A formal pitch related to work is usually done by an assigned person with the necessary technical knowledge.  
-Needed to know what is attainable and not attainable (know how software works).  

They talk about how user-centered development can be a bad approach sometimes because it often proposes a specific solution, which is not the desired approach.

## Rabbit Holes

What is a rabbit hole?:
-They also talk about rabbit holes and the importance of avoiding them. This could often lead to dead ends, no significant progress or work that end's up being abandonned.  
-Need to identify any potential rabbit holes at the beginning of the pitch.  
-Features that are cool but not used often could be potential rabbit holes.  

Tracer bullet:
-Can be used to gain information on unknown aspects.
-Allows to give a proper estimate for potential work, allows to identify rabbit holes.
-Usually about 2 days.
-Could be seen as wasted 2 days but this allows to gain knowledge.
