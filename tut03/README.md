# Summary Notes

## Pitch principals

What is a pitch?:  
-A formal pitch is a document of approximately 800 words.  
-It should contain the problem to be solved.  
-Proposes an idea or potential solution to solve the problem and gives direction to the project.  
-Should contain a certain level of abstraction.  
-Having too many details and specifications could lead the developers to spend too much time on the wrong details or lead the project in the wrong direction.  
-Too much abstraction is also not desired; for example, one ticket is not sufficient because the developer can't read minds.  

Who can pitch?:  
-Anyone with an idea can informaly pitch an idea.  
-A formal pitch related to work is usually done by an assigned person with the necessary technical knowledge.  
-Needed to know what is attainable and not attainable (know how software works).  

They talk about how user-centered development can be a bad approach sometimes because it often proposes a specific solution, which is not the desired approach.
