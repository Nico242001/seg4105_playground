## Chap 7 - Bets, Not Backlogs

This chapter discusses the issues related to backlogs. Over time backlogs acquire a lot of tasks and tickets which causes a feeling of being behind even when it's not the case. It causes alot of time wasting as the backlog needs to be reviewed and organized on regular basis. Betting is an altirnative solution to this. When betting a few well organized pitches from the last 6 weeks are gathered. This allows for no extensive backlog which makes the decision process easier. If a pitch is accepted they work on it for the next 6 weeks if not it is dropped. Individuals can track previous pitches and bring them back. Also when an important idea is forgotten it will come back.

## Chap 8 - The Betting Table 

This chapter talks about how six week cycles is used in project management. It allow for meaningful work to be done all while maintaning a sense of urgency (deadline). Unlike 2 week cycles which takes alot of planning which means you get less done for the amount of planning done. After the 6 weeks are done a cool down period follows, this allows for developpers to finish the cycle if it's not done or to work on bugs. It talks about how it is important to not interrupt the cycle for to fix bugs. It would take almost take a crisis for an interruption to be validated. Finally the use of cycles allow's for clean slates at the start of each new cycle.
