## Chap 7 - Bets, Not Backlogs

This chapter discusses the issues related to backlogs. Over time backlogs acquire a lot of tasks and tickets which causes a feeling of being behind even when it's not the case. It causes alot of time wasting as the backlog needs to be reviewed and organized on regular basis. Betting is an altirnative solution to this. When betting a few well organized pitches from the last 6 weeks are gathered. This allows for no extensive backlog which makes the decision process easier. If a pitch is accepted they work on it for the next 6 weeks if not it is dropped. Individuals can track previous pitches and bring them back. Also when an important idea is forgotten it will come back.
