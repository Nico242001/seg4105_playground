## Loic Pitch Review


Good Idea:

This would be a great feature to add to the Vaultis services users could greatly benefit from this when sharing expenses such as rent, tripsâ€¦

Workload and Timeframe:


The feature proposed would not fit into the six week cycle for development, even considering the no gos mentioned in the pitch. The size of the project would just be too much for two developers. We would need a much bigger team in order to accomplish this feature within the desired time frame. It is also a very complex feature to execute even with a bigger team.

Ambiguity:


There's some ambiguity in the feature explanation:
Is it one user paying the transaction and then getting reimbursed by other participants
Or is it everyone being charged separately for their part and paying separately

Is the payment system linked with the users bank accounts or is it the user that keeps track and inputs all received payments?

Breadboard:

Really like the breadboard it is well made. Steps are clear.

Fat maker:

Gives a good idea of the interface the user will be shown in order to make transactions.

No gos:

Clear that all no gos could be future additions, the feature they would be great ideas to add, but just not fit within the appetite.
